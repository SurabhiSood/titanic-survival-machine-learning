# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

### The Challenge
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition from Kaggle, which has been chosen as our final group project.

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS, Titanic, sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, using machine learning and passenger data provided by Kaggle, we built a predictive model that answers the question: "which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck and what sorts of people were more likely to survive?”.
