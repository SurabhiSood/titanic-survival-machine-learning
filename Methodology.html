            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px;"> RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star 
                Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage 
                from Southampton to New York City.Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died. By examining factors such as class, 
                sex, and age, in our dataset we will experiment with different machine learning algorithms and build a program that can predict whether a given 
                passenger would have survived this disaster. To get sense of the variables, their class type, and the first few observations of each. We know 
                we’re working with 1309 observations of 14 variables. To make things a bit more explicit since a couple of the variable names aren’t 
                100% illuminating, here’s what we’ve got to deal with:

                    this policy as, across all classes, women were much more likely to survive than the men.

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px;"><b>2. Logistic Regression</b> After cleaning the data (replacing missing values with the mean or mode) , we created a new feature called ‘Title’ which was extracted from ‘Name’ column. We encoded columns like ‘Sex’ ,’Title’, ’Port of embarkment’ to be used by the Machine Learning model.
                We then dropped unwanted columns from the dataframe that will not be used by the model. We selected 7 columns/features:  pclass (class of the passenger) ,survived, sex, age, sibsp(siblings-spouse relationship) ,parch(Parent-Child relationship) ,title.
                We then split the dataset in to training and testing datasets and created a Logistic Regression model to be run on the dataset. The accuracy of the model was 84%.

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 60px; margin-right: 60px;"><b>3. RandomForestClassifier</b> Started with visualizing the dataset for its variables, missing values and its datatypes.
                Leading to imputing the missing values and feature engineering new columns from the existing one as described in the charts above. Post dropping those columns 
                we do not need, converting the data into categorise to prepare them for analysing by using label encoder. After dividing the dataset into X and y 'ExtraTreesClassifier' 
                was used to select best features leading it to scale the X axis as y is already binary.We go onto split the train-test dataset and fit it to the model. The accuracy of
                the model was 79.26%
